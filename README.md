# Caro-Game
A small game created by Java Swing and Socket
This game build and run on Netbeans. The caro Game build on java swing, caro server on java core and both use socket to connect and send information.
I used log in system with data base file in Caro-server/files/users.txt. You can go and set username, password.
Before run you need to add Caro-library jar to both of Carogame and Caroserver to run.
Happy New year 2018!!!
